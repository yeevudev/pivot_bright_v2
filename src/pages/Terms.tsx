        <Section title="Acceptance of Terms">
          <p>
            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the website and consulting services provided by PivotPoint Pricing & Legal Ops ("PivotPoint," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing our website or engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that organization. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our website or services.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Services Description">
          <p>
            PivotPoint provides legal operations consulting services, including but not limited to: legal pricing strategy, alternative fee arrangement (AFA) design and implementation, legal project management (LPM), pricing operationalization, and fractional legal ops leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specific services, deliverables, timelines, and fees are defined in a separate engagement letter or statement of work ("SOW") agreed upon by both parties prior to commencement of services. These Terms apply to all engagements unless expressly superseded by a signed agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our services constitute business consulting and do not constitute legal advice. We are not a law firm and do not provide legal representation.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Engagement and Payment">
          <p>
            All engagements are formalized through a signed SOW or engagement letter specifying the scope, deliverables, timeline, and fees. Payment terms are set forth in each SOW and typically include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>Fixed-project fees due per agreed milestone schedule</li>
            <li>Monthly retainer fees due in advance for ongoing advisory engagements</li>
            <li>Reimbursement of pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Invoices are due within thirty (30) days of issuance unless otherwise specified. Late payments may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Confidentiality">
          <p>
            Both parties acknowledge that during an engagement, each may have access to confidential information belonging to the other. "Confidential Information" includes proprietary data, business strategies, pricing models, client lists, financial information, and any other non-public information designated as confidential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each party agrees to: (a) hold the other's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) use it only for purposes of the engagement; and (c) not disclose it to third parties without prior written consent, except as required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            These confidentiality obligations survive termination of the engagement for a period of three (3) years.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Intellectual Property">
          <p>
            PivotPoint retains ownership of all proprietary methodologies, frameworks, templates, tools, and know-how developed prior to or independently of any engagement ("Background IP").
          </p>
          <p>
            Deliverables specifically created for a client under an SOW ("Work Product") are assigned to the client upon full payment, subject to PivotPoint retaining a license to use underlying Background IP and anonymized learnings for future engagements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Client grants PivotPoint a limited license to use client's data and materials solely to perform the contracted services.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Representations and Warranties">

          <p>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PIVOTPOINT'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR ANY ENGAGEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY THE CLIENT IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
          </p>
          <p>
            IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
          </p>
          <p>

        </Section>

        <Section title="Termination">
          <p>
            Either party may terminate an engagement: (a) for convenience upon thirty (30) days' written notice; or (b) immediately for material breach that remains uncured after fifteen (15) days' written notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon termination: PivotPoint will deliver all completed Work Product; Client will pay for all services rendered through the termination date plus any non-cancellable expenses; and each party will return or destroy the other's Confidential Information upon request.
